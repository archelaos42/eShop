An eCommerce app with multiple product categories. The Nova admin section is within the /admin space.

In addition to the basic CRUD, products and categories can be listed and filtered through by subcategory.

Any products being tested should be provided with all of their data before testing the views, as missing elements
hinder proper rendering. This could not be completed via seeding due to time constraints.

While checkout remains incomplete due to similar reasons, a product cart has been created, and products can be added, removed,
and viewed within the cart. The cart can also be cleared.
